# Mask models

## [Julie](#design-julie---mask-with-sewing-at-nosecenter-level---sewing-pattern-made-from-the-hand)
## Origami
## Olson

A selection of reusable face masks to make yourself easily. We don't want to make a single design or perfect design but we
want to provide a set of design depending of the capabilities of the user.

Homemade face mask are not to substitute to surgical, N95, FFP2/FFP3 masks, but they may help to prevent the propagation of a virus.

How to choose a design?

- Design Julie is faster to build
- Design Origami is the most complete (has a filter pocket)
- Design Olson is better for large faces (has a filter pocket)

## Design Julie - mask with sewing at nose/center level - sewing pattern made from the hand

Original design of masks by [Julie Foucre](https://www.instagram.com/julie_jfo/). The video below describes all the steps to build your own masks with
you have some sewing experience and the required equipments.

The face mask uses rubber bands for hair.

### Step-by-step guide for the design Julie

### Step 1

- Draw patterns on fabric;
- The lines are the lines to be cut;
- the seam will be 0.7 cm from the edge:

### Step 2 - Step 3

- Here is the cut pattern;
- There must be four;
- Two for the inside, two for the outside:

### Step 4

- Sew the two pieces for each side;
- Sew 0.7 cm from the edge;
- Remember to double the thread at the ends so that the seam does not jump:

### Step 5 - Step 6

- Lay the faces flat;
- Sewing towards you:

### Step 7 - Step 8 and Step 9

- Lay the faces against each other, the seams outwards;
- Sew the two sides together, 0.7 cm;
- Start at the top of the left edge then go around in a seam, stop at the bottom of the left edge, to leave an opening;
- Be careful not to sew the center seam flat, it will reduce the depth of the mask:

### Step 10

- Gently invert the mask from the inside;
- Clear the corners:

### Step 11 - Step 12 and Step 13

- Fold the fabric from the left edge inward and sew to close the mask;
- Then sew to strengthen the mask all the edge to 0.5 cm:

### Step 13 finish

- Fold over the edges and sew to pass the lace. About 1.5 cm.

### Step 14 if you want to add a filter pocket

:warning: It will make the mask a little bit thiner with the fabric you sew so far. If you need a mask with filter pocket, we recommand the Olson design instead.

- Add another 2 pieces of fabric from the initial design, that you sew together as when you start the mask.
- Cut each side at the size you want the filter pocket to be, about 3 or 4 cm off. Sew the edges of this last layer to reinforce the fabric.
- Put this last piece you sew, on the top of the mask, sewing towards you :

### Step 15

- Sew the top edge and the bottom edge onto the mask.

### Step 16

- Gently invert the mask from the inside;

### Step 17
- Fold over the edges and sew to pass the lace. About 1.5 cm.

### Step 23

### nose pliers

- Add a piece of fabric, rectangular a few cm (5 on average), made with the scraps.
- Sew the top and bottom of the small piece directly inside the mask, so that the shape follows the wing of the nose.
- Slide a metal wire or a metal food clip for example. The metal piece can be removed for machine washing the mask.

### tip to pass the laces

- Use a metal wire folded in half, which will catch the lace at one end of the fold and then pass it through the fold.

## Design 3 - mask folded fabrics without sewing at nose/center level

Based on [DIY Covid-19 Fabric Mask (with Filter Pocket) Sewing Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9RWII2-5_4), simpler than the previous ones to make but also requires an iron to make the folds and pliers to hold folds during sewing. Cover the face well but go up too much on the nose and let air pass up at the level of the wings of the nose.
You can add a small metal clip to pinch the nose and avoid the mask to move.

## How to use and clean your masks

- Do not touch the mask and its fasteners while you are wearing it.
- While fastening your mask, only touch the elastics or the borders.
- A mask must be specific to each person. Do not lend or exchange it.
- The mask must cover nose and mouth (respiratory tracts).
- Wash at 60°C after each use.
- Dry the mask thoroughly including straps.
- Keep it in a dry place and not in contact with other clothes.

There are also alternative cleaning solution such as hydrogen peroxide but these solutions might not be accessible to everyone.

# Mianmö project

Mianmö project is an open source project to allow everyone to build and assemble cloth face masks. The project name is based on the Chinese word 面膜 which means facial mask and a minor IKEAization of the word.
