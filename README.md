# Mask models

A selection of reusable face masks to make yourself easily. We don't want to make a single design or perfect design but we
want to provide a set of design depending of the capabilities of the user.

Homemade face mask are not to substitute to surgical, N95, FFP2/FFP3 masks, but they may help to prevent the propagation of a virus.

How to choose a design?

- Design Julie is faster to build
- Design origami is the most complete
- Design 3 is better for large faces

## Design Julie - mask with sewing at nose/center level - sewing pattern made from the hand

Original design of masks by [Julie Foucre](https://www.instagram.com/julie_jfo/). The video below describes all the steps to build your own masks with
you have some sewing experience and the required equipments.

The face mask uses rubber bands for hair.

### Step-by-step guide for the design Julie

### Step 1

- Draw patterns on fabric, the lines are the lines to be cut, the seam will be 0.7 cm from the edge:

## Design 3 - mask folded fabrics without sewing at nose/center level

Based on [DIY Covid-19 Fabric Mask (with Filter Pocket) Sewing Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9RWII2-5_4), simpler than the previous ones to make but also requires an iron to make the folds and pliers to hold folds during sewing. Cover the face well but go up too much on the nose and let air pass up at the level of the wings of the nose.
You can add a small metal clip to pinch the nose and avoid the mask to move.

## How to use and clean your masks

- Do not touch the mask and its fasteners while you are wearing it.
- While fastening your mask, only touch the elastics or the borders.
- A mask must be specific to each person. Do not lend or exchange it.
- The mask must cover nose and mouth (respiratory tracts).
- Wash at 60°C after each use.
- Dry the mask thoroughly including straps.
- Keep it in a dry place and not in contact with other clothes.

There are also alternative cleaning solution such as hydrogen peroxide but these solutions might not be accessible to everyone.
