## FAIL 1

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C00kie-/DIY-face-masks/master/images/failed/fail_mask1.jpeg)

Design too big, does not allow to adjust to the chin and cheeks, the cotton lining added inside removes mask from the nose.

What we learned: fabric fastening system to pass over the top of the head is recommended.
